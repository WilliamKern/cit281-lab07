# CIT 281 Lab 07

## Overview  
Lab 07 introduced modern JavaScript module syntax, focusing on how to structure programs using `import` and `export`. I practiced writing modular code by defining functions or constants in one file and importing them into another using ES6 module syntax. This lab also reinforced the use of object and array destructuring, and clarified the differences between default and named exports.

## Objectives  
- Understand the difference between CommonJS and ES Modules
- Use `export` and `import` syntax to share code across files
- Practice object and array destructuring for cleaner code
- Apply modular organization to improve code readability and reuse
- Demonstrate use of multiple `.js` files with clean function structure

## Deliverables  
- JavaScript module files demonstrating `export` and `import` syntax  
- Screenshot (`.png`) showing successful output or module interaction  
- Possibly notes or examples of destructuring and modular design  

## What I Learned  
This lab helped me get comfortable with separating code into modules and using modern ES6 syntax for sharing functionality. Understanding the difference between default and named exports, and seeing how destructuring simplifies variable assignment, made me more confident in writing clean, maintainable JavaScript code.
